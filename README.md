# 2PGA (2-clb FPGA design)
2PGA is an "FPGA" design with I/O pads, 2 combinational logic blocks, and routing logic between the 2 CLBs.

This project contains the FPGA implementation, as well as the software built to program it.

The FPGA programming UI was built with <https://github.com/raysan5/raygui>, as a kind of "homage" to the original XACT software made by Xilinx
